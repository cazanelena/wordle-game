# wordle-game

- I created a simple clone version of the wordle game. For the frontend I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript and hosted it as a stactic website using aws S3 bucket.

# User Stories

- I split the game into 5 user stories. This can be found in the issues section. 

- For each of them I used the MoSCoW method (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have this time) to help me prioritise requirements. 

# Deployment
 
 - I deployed the website on aws s3 using terraform. The url is [here] (https://elenas-wordle.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html)
 - I wrote a script that uploads the frontend files to the S3 bucket.
